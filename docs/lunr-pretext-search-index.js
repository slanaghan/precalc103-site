  "title": "Representing Mathematical Relationships",
  "body": " Representing Mathematical Relationships  Mathematical relationships between two quantities can be represented in multiple ways: as a table, as a graph or as an equation. Each of these representations adds to our understanding of a mathematical situation, and we should be able to approach a given situation by considering each of these representations.     This diagram showing four interconnected representations of a mathematical relationship: Graph, Table, Equation, and Verbal Description. The Graph is at the top, with arrows pointing to both Table and Equation. Table and Equation are connected by a double arrow. The label Verbal Description appears in the center, indicating connections among all three representations.     The domain of a function is the set of inputs to the function. The range of a function is the set of outputs from the function.

Customers can order a pond in any size square, starting with sides measuring 2 feet, and available in one-foot increments thereafter (sides of 3 feet, 4 feet, 5 feet, etc.). The tiles are 1-foot square, and are placed edge-to-edge along the entire outer perimeter of the pond. An example pond is shown below.    A 4×4 grid with a centered 2×2 block of dark shaded squares.  Sample Pond of Side Length 2      Make a table showing the number of border tiles needed for different pond sizes, from 2-foot sides up through 6-foot sides.    If the side length of the pond is increased by 1 foot, how many more border tiles are needed? Explain why the number of tiles is increasing according to this pattern.    How many border tiles are needed for a pond with sides of length 12 feet?    If Nancy orders 64 border tiles for an upcoming job, how large is the pond the customer wants?    Describe in words how to find the number of tiles needed for the border of a pond.    Write an equation for the number of tiles as a function of the length of one side of the pond.      A local doughnut shop charges $9 for the first dozen doughnuts purchased, and $0.50 for each additional individual doughnut purchased.    Write a linear function for , the cost of doughnuts.    For what values of does your equation from make sense?    How much will 20 doughnuts cost?    Your club is having a fundraiser reselling doughnuts from this shop. You were given $20 to buy doughnuts to resell. How many doughnuts can you buy?    Using your answer from , what is the average cost of each doughnut?    Your club wants to sell the doughnuts for $1 and make a profit of at least $0.45 on each doughnut. What is the minimum number of doughnuts you need to buy (and sell) in order for this to happen?      Stephanie is planting her summer garden. She purchased a sunflower plant from a nursery and planted it when it was 6 cm tall. After she planted it, the sunflower plant grew at a constant rate of 3 cm per day.    Write a function, that gives the height of the sunflower plant as a function of , the number of days since the plant was planted.    A worker at the nursery told Stephanie that her sunflower would reach its maximum height about 40 days after it was planted. What will the height be at that time?    How many days after planting would the sunflower be half its maximum height?    Consider your function from part . What domain and range make sense in the context of this problem?       Isabella is considering renting a car for one day to drive to an event in another city. Company A charges $20 per day plus $0.25 per mile, and Company B charges $25 per day plus $0.15 per mile.    Write a linear function equation that models the one day cost of renting a car from Company A, , as function of , the number of miles driven.    Write a linear function equation that models the one day cost of renting a car from Company B, , as function of , the number of miles driven.    Graph and on the axes below. Use the graph to estimate the number of miles for which the cost for Company A is the same as the cost for Company B.    A blank coordinate grid with the horizontal axis labeled m from 0 to 80 and the vertical axis labeled C(m) from 0 to 60.  Coordinate grid for rental cost function       Use algebra to find the number of miles for which the cost for Company A is the same as the cost for Company B.    If the event Isabella is going to is a 60 mile round trip drive, which rental company should she choose? How much will she save by choosing that company?     "
